**PAYROLL TAX ANALYSIS IN THE NIGERIAN SITUATION**

**Proiect Overview**

This project simulates a real-world payroll and tax compliance engagement where a Data Analyst is tasked with redesigning a legacy Excel-based PAYE system to align with the Nigeria Personal Income Tax Reform Act 2025. The organisation currently relies on a fragile payroll workbook with hard-coded tax rates complex nested IF formulas, and limited audit transparency. As tax rules evolve, the model frequently breaks, creating compliance risks and operational inefficiencies. Using Microsoft Excel, this project focuses on building a flexible, auditable, and scalable PAYE analysis model that supports accurate tax computation for 1 to 1,000 employees, while enabling HR, Finance, and Management teams to clearly understand payroll tax outcomes under the 2025 tax regime. The final deliverable is a robust Excel-based PAYE model designed with structured tax tables, clear logic separation, and business-level reporting that can be reviewed confidently by auditors and adapted easily when tax laws change.

**Business Obiective**

The purpose of this project is to support payrol accuracy, regulatory compliance and financial transparency by answering key business questions such as: 

1.) Are employee PAYE deductions correctly calculated under the 2025 tax bands? 

2.) How do changes in tax law impact employee net pay and total payroll cost? 

3.) Can the payroll model adapt quickly to future tax reforms without rewriting formulas? 

4.) Is the PAYE computation logic clear, traceable, and auditable?

**Targeted Audience**

1.) HR & Payroll Teams 

2.) Finance & Accounting Teams 

3.) Internal & External Auditors 

4.) Senior Management & Business Owners

**Decisions Enabled**

Assessment of payroll cost impact under the 2025 tax reform Improved tax compliance and audit readiness Faster updates when tax rates or bands change Standardisation of payroll logic across the organisation Risk reduction from manual errors and broken formulas

**Dataset** 

The dataset used in this project represents a simulated employee payroll register, including Employee earnings and allowances Taxable income components PAYE tax bands and rates (2025 structure Employee-level and summary payroll outputs

**Expected Outcome**

1.) Design and restructure a legacy Excel payroll system to comply with the Nigeria Personal Income Tax Reform Act 2025.

2.) Replace hard-coded tax rates and complex nested IF logic with flexible table-driven PAYE calculations.

3.) Build dynamic PAY E tax band tables that can be updated easily when tax laws change

4.) Develop clear and auditable Excel logic for employee-level PAYE computation.

5.) Support payroll processing for organisations with 1 to 1,000 employees.

6.) Create business-level summary reporting for HR, Finance, and Management review.

7.) Structure the model with clear separation between inputs, calculations. and outputs to improve transparency.

8.) Ensure the final model is easy to review by internal and external auditors.
